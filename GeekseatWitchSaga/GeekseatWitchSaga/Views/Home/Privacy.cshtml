<h2>The story: Geekseat Witch Saga: Return of The Coder!</h2>

<br />

<p>Somewhere far far away, there is a village which is controlled by a dark and cunning witch.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this witch is also a die-hard programmer.</p>

<br />

<p>The witch has power to control death and life of the villager.</p>
<p>The witch will kill a number of villagers each year.</p>

<br />

<p>Since the witch is a die hard programmer, she follow a specific rule to decide the number of villagers she should kill each year.</p>

<br />

<p>On the 1st year she kills 1 villager</p>
<p>On the 2nd year she kills 1 + 1 = 2 villagers</p>
<p>On the 3rd year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 villagers</p>
<p>On the 4th year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 villages</p>
<p>On the 5th year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12 villagers</p>
<p>And so on...</p>

<br />

<p>The villagers are furious with the witch and want to get rid of her and there is one way to get rid of her.</p>
<p>The witch will only leave if there is a brave programmer in the villager who can create a program to solve this problem:</p>

<br />
<p>If given two people whose age of death and year of death are known, find the average number of people the witch killed on year of birth of those people</p>

<br />
<p>Example:</p>

<br />

<p>Given:</p>
<p>Person A: Age of death = 10, Year of Death = 12</p>
<p>Person B: Age of death = 13, Year of Death = 17</p>

<br />

<p>Answer:</p>
<p> Person A born on Year = 12 – 10 = 2, number of people killed on year 2 is 2.</p>
<p> Person B born on Year = 17 – 13 = 4, number of people killed on year 4 is 7.</p>
<p> So the average is ( 7 + 2 )/2 = 4.5</p>

<br />

<p>If you give invalid data (i.e. negative age, person who born before the witch took control) the program should return -1.</p>

<br />

<p>So, if a villager who can create a program to solve the problem, the witch will leave, and the killing will be stopped.</p>

<br />

<p>There was one programmer who was able to solve the problem, but the witch did not like the code because the code was messy and make her angry.</p>
<p>She then proceeded to kill the programmer. Now the villagers know that they also need to make the code clean and structured.</p>

<br />

<p>Now you are asked by the villager to make the code by previous programmer cleaner and beautifully structured.</p>

<br />

<p>Note that the witch loves OOP and math very much. And also note that year is started since the witch take control of the village.</p>

<br />

<p>Since you’re on your own, it will be much safer to write unit test. Plus point if you do it.</p>
